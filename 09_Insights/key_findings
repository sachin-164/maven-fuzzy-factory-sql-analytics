## Key Business Insights

### 1. A large share of website traffic does not convert into buyers

While the website receives a high volume of sessions, only a small percentage of users complete a purchase. The biggest drop-off happens between viewing a product and adding it to the cart, which suggests that users are interested but are not convinced to move forward. This points to possible issues with product pricing, product descriptions, or the add-to-cart experience.

### 2. Not all marketing channels are equally valuable

Some channels generate a lot of traffic but contribute very little revenue, while others produce fewer sessions but much higher revenue per session. This shows that traffic volume alone is misleading. The business is spending effort on channels that bring visitors who do not buy, while other channels bring smaller but more profitable audiences.

### 3. Direct and organic traffic plays a major role

A significant portion of revenue comes from users who arrive without paid marketing tags, which indicates strong brand awareness or repeat visits. These users tend to convert better than many paid channels, making them a critical source of profitable traffic.

### 4. A few products drive most of the revenue

Revenue is highly concentrated in a small number of products. While these top products are strong performers, this also creates risk. If demand for these products drops, total revenue would be heavily affected. The business depends too much on a narrow product set.

---

### 5. Some high-selling products also have high refund rates

A few products that sell well also generate a large number of refunds. This reduces real profitability and may signal quality issues, misleading product descriptions, or customer expectation gaps. These products may be hurting the brand even if their sales look strong on the surface.

### 6. Refunds create a noticeable revenue leak

Refunds account for a meaningful loss of revenue. Even when sales look healthy, part of that money is being given back. This means that improving product quality and reducing refunds could increase profitability without needing to attract more traffic.
